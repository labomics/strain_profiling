# Strain profiling pipeline for the human gut metagenome

## Overview

This pipeline could estimate coverages,depths and abudances of strains rather than species in metagenomic samples.

To use this pipeline, you should first confirm which species you want to focus on to estimate strains profile of it. To find a candidate species, a SNP analysis could be performed first. [Our metagenomic SNP calling pipeline](https://github.com/labomics/metagenomic_SNP_calling)

Reference genomes should be prepared, including both the target strains and other strains presenting in a metagenomic sample.

You could also generate sythetic data to check the performance of this pipeline.
